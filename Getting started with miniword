To play MiniWord, users need a Farcaster account, which can be created at farcaster.xyz. Once signed in, they can access MiniWord via Warpcast’s Mini Apps directory (warpcast.com/~/mini-apps) or a direct link within a Farcaster client. The app’s intuitive interface likely guides users through gameplay, with options to share results or invite friends. Developers interested in building similar Mini Apps can explore Farcaster’s documentation at docs.farcaster.xyz or join the /fc-devs channel for community support.
