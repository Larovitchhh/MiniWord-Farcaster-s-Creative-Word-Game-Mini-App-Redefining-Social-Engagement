Farcaster, a decentralized social network built on Ethereum, is transforming how users connect and interact online by prioritizing user ownership and permissionless innovation. At the heart of its ecosystem are Mini Apps, lightweight web-based applications built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that integrate seamlessly into Farcaster clients, leveraging features like authentication, notifications, and wallet interactions. One such Mini App, MiniWord (accessible via Warpcast’s Mini Apps directory), is a word-based game that brings creativity and social dynamics to Farcaster’s community. This article explores MiniWord’s functionality, its role within Farcaster, and its impact on decentralized social networking.
